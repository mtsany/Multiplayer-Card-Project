1) Set directory to the main folder "card-game" and run the following codes:
	- "npm init"
	- "npm install" (should install ALL dependencies)

2) Do step 1 but set directory to client


RUNNING SERVER:
Set directory to card-game/. Run "npm run start"

RUNNING LOCAL ON PORT 8080:
Set directory to card-game/client/. In terminal, run "npm start"


If above code does not work/missing dependencies, run this code:

MAIN FOLDER: .card-game/
1) "npm init"
2) "npm install --save express socket.io nodemon"
3) "npm run start"

CLIENT FOLDER: .card-game/client/
1) "npm init"
2) "npm install --save socket.io-client"
3) "npm start"
